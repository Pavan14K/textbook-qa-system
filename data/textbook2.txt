The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends
that children's life at school must be linked to their life outside
the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of
bookish learning which continues to shape our system and
causes a gap between the school, home and community. The
syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an
attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a
child-centred system of education outlined  in the National Policy
of Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect
on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and
questions. W e must r ecogni se that, given space, time and fr eedom,
children generate new knowledge by engaging with the
information passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed
textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons
why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children
as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body
of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines
and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as
necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so
that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will
also determine how effective this book proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source
of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater
consideration for child psychology and the time available for
Reprint 2024-25
ivteaching. The supplementary reader attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities
for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups,
and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining
(NCER T) appr eciates the har d work done by the textbook
development committee r esponsible for this book. W e wish to
thank the Chairperson of the advisory committee
for textbooks in languages for the secondary stage,

Professor R. Amritavalli  for guiding the work of this committee.
Several teachers contributed to the development of this

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the
content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative
mindset. In this backgr ound, the NCER T has undertaken the exer cise to
rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already
developed by the NCER T across classes have been taken into consideration in
this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and supplementary
readers at different stages of school education.
•Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing
language proficiency and is accessible at different stages.
•For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of the
previling condition of the Pandemic.
•Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or
peer-learning.
•Content, which is irrelevant in the present context.
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.

A Note to the TA Note to the TA Note to the TA Note to the TA Note to the T eachereachereachereachereacher
Footprints without Feet , a supplementary reader in English for
Class X, is based on the new syllabus prepared as a follow -up to
the National Curriculum Framework, 2005. The curriculum
envisages language learning opportunities that are rich in
comprehensible input, and adopts a language-across-the-
curriculum, multilingual perspective on English in the school.
Input-rich communicational environments are a prerequisite
for language learning. Therefore, learners must be exposed to a
variety  of texts.
The supplementary reader is meant for students to read on
their own; it aims at developing their reading skills. Learners
need to develop the habit of reading for information and
pleasure, drawing inferences from what they read, and relating
texts to their previous knowledge. They need to learn to
read critically and to develop the confidence to ask and
answer questions.
The selections in the supplementary reader take into
account the interests of young learners while making them
aware of issues that they need to reflect on: personal
relationships, the neighbourhood, and the community. Thematic
variety has been taken care of and there is a good representation
of a variety of genres as well as of writers from across the worl d—
Indian, British, French, American and Japanese. This
supplementary reader has ten pieces including a play and a
factual prose piece, as well as science fiction.
Each piece begins with questions under the head ‘Read and
Find Out’ to guide learners in their reading and comprehension
of the text, which is divided into two to three sections, each
section prefaced with relevant questions. Thus the texts do
not need to be read out or explained by the teacher in class.
Word glosses have similarly been kept to the minimum so as
to encourage inferences about meaning from sentential
and discourse contexts. The teacher , after a quick oral
comprehension check, if necessary, can progress to the questions
Reprint 2024-25
under the head ‘Think About It’ at the end of each unit. These
are meant to take the learner beyond factual comprehension to
contemplate on the issues that the texts raise; the questions are
open ended and thought provoking.
The questions given under ‘Talk About It’ are intended to
encourage the learners to express their own ideas in a creative
and coherent way. It is hoped that the topics suggested for
discussion will encourage learners to develop a constructive
analysis of the relevant issues, involving critical thinking,
reasoning, and previous knowledge as well as new knowledge.
The list of suggested readings given at the end of each story
is meant to encourage learners to read further on their own.
The idea is to promote the habit of self-learning and reduce
dependence on the teacher .
Language learning is essentially a matter of acquiring in an
integrated way the skills of listening, speaking, reading and
writing; and of honing these skills for effective communication
in the classroom, and later in real life. This book offers an
opportunity for taking learners in that direction.

READ AND FIND OUT
•Why is Mr s Pumphr ey worried a bout Tricki?
•What does she do to help him? Is she wise in this?
•Who does ‘I’ refer to in this stor y?
I WAS really worried about T ricki this time. I had pulled up my car
when I saw him in the street with his mistress and I was shocked at
his appearance. He had become hugely fat, like a bloated sausage with
a leg at each cor ner. His eyes, bloodshot and r heumy, star ed straight
ahead and his tongue lolled from his jaws.
Mrs Pumphrey hastened to explain, “He was so listless, Mr Herriot.
He seemed to have no energy. I thought he must be suffering from
malnutrition, so I have been giving him some little extras between
meals to build him up, some malt and cod-liver oil and a bowl of
Horlicks at night to make him sleep — nothing much really.”
“And did you cut down on the sweet things as I told you?”
“Oh, I did for a bit, but he seemed to be so weak I had to relent. He
does love cream cakes and chocolates so. I can’t bear to refuse him.”
I looked down again at the little dog. That was the tr ouble. T ricki’s
only fault was greed. He had never been known to refuse food; he
would tackle a meal at any hour of the day or night. And I wondered
about all the things Mrs Pumphrey hadn’t mentioned.
“Are you giving him plenty of exercise?”
“Well, he has his little walks with me as you can see, but Hodgkin,
the gar dener , has been down with lumbago, so ther e has been no

I tried to sound severe: “Now I really mean this. If you don’t cut his
food right down and give him more exercise he is going to be really ill.
You must har den your heart and keep him on a very strict diet.”
Mrs Pumphrey wrung her hands. “Oh I will, Mr Herriot. I’m sure
you are right, but it is so difficult, so very difficult.” She set off, head
down, along the road, as if determined to put the new regime into
practice immediately.
I watched their pr ogress with gr owing concer n. Tricki was tottering
along in his little tweed coat; he had a whole wardrobe of these coats —
for the cold weather and a raincoat for the wet days. He struggled on,
drooping in his harness. I thought it wouldn’t be long before I heard
from Mrs Pumphrey.
The expected call came within a few days. Mrs Pumphrey was
distraught. T ricki would eat nothing. Refused even his favourite dishes;
and besides, he had bouts of vomiting. He spent all his time lying on a
rug, panting. Didn’t want to go for walks, didn’t want to do anything.
I had made my plans in advance. The only way was to get T ricki out
of the house for a period. I suggested that he be hospitalised for about
a fortnight to be kept under observation.
The poor lady almost swooned. She was sure he would pine and die
if he did not see her every day.
But I took a fir m line. T ricki was very ill and this was the only way
to save him; in fact, I thought it best to take him without delay and,
Reprint 2024-25
A Triumph of Surgery 3follow ed by Mrs Pumphrey’s wailings, I marched out to the car carrying
the little dog wrapped in a blanket.
The entire staff was roused and maids rushed in and out bringing
his day bed, his night bed, favourite cushions, toys and rubber rings,
breakfast bowl, lunch bowl, supper bowl. Realising that my car would
never hold all the stuff, I started to drive away. As I moved off, Mrs
Pumphrey, with a despairing cry, threw an armful of the little coats
through the window. I looked in the mirror before I turned the corner
of the drive; everybody was in tears.
Out on the road, I glanced down at the pathetic little animal gasping
on the seat by my side. I patted the head and T ricki made a brave
effort to wag his tail. “Poor old lad,” I said. “Y ou haven’t a kick in you
but I think I know a cure for you.”

triumph of  surgery”?
At the sur gery, the household dogs sur ged r ound me. T ricki looked
down at the noisy pack with dull eyes and, when put down, lay motionless
on the carpet. The other dogs, after sniffing round him for a few seconds,
decided he was an uninteresting object and ignored him.
I made up a bed for him in a warm loose box next to the one where
the other dogs slept. For two days I kept an eye on him, giving him no
food but plenty of water . At the end of the second day he started to
show some interest in his surroundings and on the third he began to
whimper when he heard the dogs in the yard.
When I opened the door , Tricki tr otted out and was immediately
engulfed by Joe, the greyhound, and his friends. After rolling him over
and thoroughly inspecting him, the dogs moved off down the garden.
Tricki followed them, r olling slightly with his surplus fat.
Later that day, I was pr esent at feeding time. I watched while T ristan
slopped the food into the bowls. There was the usual headlong rush
followed by the sounds of high-speed eating; every dog knew that if he
fell behind the others he was liable to have some competition for the
last part of his meal.

Footprints without F eet 4
When they had finished, Tricki took a walk round the shining bowls,
licking casually inside one or two of them. Next day, an extra bowl was
put out for him and I was pleased to see him jostling his way towards it.
From then on, his progress was rapid. He had no medicinal treatment
of any kind but all day he ran about with the dogs, joining in their
friendly scrimmages. He discover ed the joys of being bowled over , tramped
on and squashed every few minutes. He became an accepted member of
the gang, an unlikely, silky little object among the shaggy crew, fighting
like a tiger for his share at mealtimes and hunting rats in the old hen -
house at night. He had never had such a time in his life.
All the while, Mrs Pumphrey hovered anxiously in the background,
ringing a dozen times a day for the latest bulletins. I dodged the
questions about whether his cushions were being turned regularly or
his correct coat worn according to the weather; but I was able to tell
her that the little fellow was out of danger and convalescing rapidly.
The word ‘convalescing’ seemed to do something to Mrs Pumphrey.
She started to bring round fresh eggs, two dozen at a time, to build up
Tricki’s str ength. For a happy period my partners and I had two eggs
each for breakfast, but when the bottles of wine began to arrive, the
real possibilities of the situation began to dawn on the household.
It was to enrich T ricki’s blood. Lunch became a cer emonial occasion
with two glasses of wine before and several during the meal.

A Triumph of Surgery 5
We could har dly believe it when the brandy came to put a final edge
on T ricki’s constitution. For a few nights the fine spirit was r olled
around, inhaled and reverently drunk.
They were days of deep content, starting well with the extra egg in
the morning, improved and sustained by the midday wine and finishing
luxuriously round the fire with the brandy.
It was a temptation to keep T ricki on as a per manent guest, but
I knew Mrs Pumphrey was suffering and after a fortnight, felt
compelled to phone and tell her that the little dog had recovered
and was awaiting collection.
Within minutes, about thirty feet of gleaming black metal drew up
outside the surgery. The chauffeur opened the door and I could just
make out the figur e of Mrs Pumphr ey almost lost in the interior . Her
hands were tightly clasped in front of her; her lips trembled. “Oh, Mr
Herriot, do tell me the truth. Is he really better?”
“Yes, he’s fine. Ther e’s no need for you to get out of the car — I’ll go
and  fetch him.”
I walked through the house into the garden. A mass of dogs was
hurtling round and round the lawn and in their midst, ears flapping,
tail waving, was the little golden figur e of T ricki. In two weeks he had
been transformed into a lithe, hard-muscled animal; he was keeping
up well with the pack, stretching out in great bounds, his chest almost
brushing the ground.
I carried him back along the passage to the front of the house. The

•What does he g et from Anil in r eturn for his w ork?
I WAS still a thief when I met Anil. And though only 15, I was an
experienced and fairly successful hand.
Anil was watching a wrestling match when I approached him. He
was about 25 — a tall, lean fellow — and he looked easy-going, kind
and simple enough for my purpose. I hadn’t had much luck of late and
thought I might be able to get into the young man’s confidence.
“You look a bit of a wrestler yourself,” I said. A little flattery helps
in making friends.
“So do you,” he replied, which put me off for a moment because at
that time I was rather thin.
“Well,” I said modestly, “I do wr estle a bit.”
“What’s your name?”
“Hari Singh,” I lied. I took a new name every month. That kept me
ahead of the police and my former employers.
After this introduction, Anil talked about the well-oiled wrestlers
who were grunting, lifting and throwing each other about. I didn’t
have much to say. Anil walked away. I followed casually.
“Hello again,” he said.
I gave him my most appealing smile. “I want to work for you,” I said.
“But I can’t pay you.”
Reprint 2024-25
I thought that over for a minute. Perhaps I had misjudged my man.
I asked, “Can you feed me?”
“Can you cook?”
“I can cook,” I lied again.
“If you can cook, then may be I can feed you.”
He took me to his room over the Jumna Sweet Shop and told me I
could sleep on the balcony. But the meal I cooked that night must
have been terrible because Anil gave it to a stray dog and told me to be
off. But I just hung around, smiling in my most appealing way, and he
couldn’t help laughing.
Later , he patted me on the head and said never mind, he’d teach
me to cook. He also taught me to write my name and said he would
soon teach me to write whole sentences and to add numbers. I was
grateful. I knew that once I could write like an educated man there
would be no limit to what I could achieve.
It was quite pleasant working for Anil. I made the tea in the morning
and then would take my time buying the day’s supplies, usually making
a profit of about a rupee a day. I think he knew I made a little money
this way but he did not seem to mind.

the next. He kept worrying about his next cheque, but as soon as it
arrived he would go out and celebrate. It seems he wrote for magazines —
a queer way to make a living!
One evening he came home with a small bundle of notes, saying he
had just sold a book to a publisher . At night, I saw him tuck the money

I had been working for Anil for almost a month and, apart from
cheating on the shopping, had not done anything in my line of work. I
had every opportunity for doing so. Anil had given me a key to the door ,
and I could come and go as I pleased. He was the most trusting person
I had ever met.
And that is why it was so difficult to rob him. It’s easy to rob a
greedy man, because he can afford to be robbed; but it’s difficult to rob
a careless man — sometimes he doesn’t even notice he’s been robbed
and that takes all the pleasure out of the work.
Well, it’s time I did some r eal work, I told myself; I’m out of practice.
And if I don’t take the money, he’ll only waste it on his friends. After
all, he doesn’t even pay me.

Anil was asleep. A beam of moonlight stepped over the balcony and
fell on the bed. I sat up on the floor , considering the situation. If I took
the money, I could catch the 10.30 Express to Lucknow. Slipping out of
the blanket, I crept up to the bed. Anil was sleeping peacefully. His
face was clear and unlined; even I had more marks on my face, though
mine were mostly scars.
My hand slid under the mattress, searching for the notes. When I
found them, I drew them out without a sound. Anil sighed in his sleep
and turned on his side, towards me. I was startled and quickly crawled
out of the room.
When I was on the road, I began to run. I had the notes at my waist,
held there by the string of my pyjamas. I slowed down to a walk and
counted the notes: 600 rupees in fifties! I could live like an oil-rich
Arab for a week or two.

The Thief’s Story 11
When I reached the station I did not stop at the ticket office (I had
never bought a ticket in my life) but dashed straight to the platform.
The Lucknow Express was just moving out. The train had still to pick
up speed and I should have been able to jump into one of the carriages,
but I hesitated — for some reason I can’t explain — and I lost the
chance to get away.
When the train had gone, I found myself standing alone on the
deserted platform. I had no idea where to spend the night. I had no
friends, believing that friends were more trouble than help. And I did
not want to make anyone curious by staying at one of the small hotels
near the station. The only person I knew really well was the man I had
robbed. Leaving the station, I walked slowly thr ough the bazaar .
In my short career as a thief, I had made a study of men’s faces
when they had lost their goods. The greedy man showed fear; the rich
man showed anger; the poor man showed acceptance. But I knew that
Anil’s face, when he discovered the theft, would show only a touch of
sadness. Not for the loss of money, but for the loss of trust.
I found myself in the maidan  and sat down on a bench. The night
was chilly — it was early November — and a light drizzle added to my
discomfort. Soon it was raining quite heavily. My shirt and pyjamas
stuck to my skin, and a cold wind blew the rain across my face.

Anil’s money. In the morning he would probably have given me two or
three rupees to go to the cinema, but now I had it all. I couldn’t cook his
meals, run to the bazaar or learn to write whole sentences any more.
I had forgotten about them in the excitement of the theft. Whole
sentences, I knew, could one day bring me more than a few hundred
rupees. It was a simple matter to steal — and sometimes just as simple
to be caught. But to be a really big man, a clever and respected man,
was something else. I  should go back to Anil, I told myself, if only to
learn to read and write.
I hurried back to the room feeling very nervous, for it is much
easier to steal something than to return it undetected. I opened the
door quietly, then stood in the doorway, in clouded moonlight. Anil
was still asleep. I crept to the head of the bed, and my hand came up
with the notes. I felt his breath on my hand. I remained still for a
minute. Then my hand found the edge of the mattress, and slipped
under it with the notes.
I awoke late next morning to find that Anil had already made the
tea. He stretched out his hand towards me. There was a fifty-rupee
note between his fingers. My heart sank. I thought I had been discovered.
“I made some money yesterday,” he explained. “Now you’ll be paid
regularly.”
My spirits rose. But when I took the note, I saw it was still wet from
the night’s rain.
“Today we’ll start writing sentences,” he said.
He knew. But neither his lips nor his eyes showed anything. I smiled
at Anil in my most appealing way. And the smile came by itself, without
any effort.

AUSABLE did not fit any description of a secret agent Fowler had ever
read. Following him down the musty corridor of the gloomy French
hotel where Ausable had a room, Fowler felt let down. It was a
small r oom, on the sixth and top floor , and scar cely a setting for a
romantic adventure.
Ausable was, for one thing, fat. Very fat. And then there was his
accent. Though he spoke French and German passably, he had never
altogether lost the American accent he had brought to Paris from Boston
twenty years ago.
“You ar e disappointed,” Ausable said wheezily over his shoulder .
“You wer e told that I was a secr et agent, a spy, dealing in espionage

and r omantic. Y ou envisioned mysterious figur es in the night, the crack

stood aside to let his frustrated guest enter .

Some day soon that paper may well affect the course of history. In that

As he spoke, Ausable closed the door behind him. Then he switched
on the light.
And as the light came on, Fowler had his first authentic thrill of
the day. For halfway across the room, a small automatic pistol in his
hand, stood a man.
Ausable blinked a few times.
“Max,” he wheezed, “you gave me quite a start. I thought you were

raise the devil with the management this time, and you can bet on it,”
he said grimly. “This is the second time in a month that somebody has
got into my room through that nuisance of a balcony!” Fowler’s eyes
went to the single window of the room. It was an ordinary window,
against which now the night was pressing blackly.
 “Balcony?” Max said, with a rising inflection. “No, a passkey. I did
not know about the balcony. It might have saved me some trouble
had I known.”
“It’s not my balcony,” Ausable said with extreme irritation. “It belongs
to the next apartment.” He glanced explanatorily at Fowler . “You see,”
he said, “this room used to be part of a large unit, and the next room —
through that door there — used to be the living room. It had the balcony,
which extends under my window now. You can get onto it fr om the
empty room two doors dow n — and somebody did, last month. The
management promised to block it off. But they haven’t.”
Max glanced at Fowler , who was standing stif fly not far  fr om Ausable,
and waved the gun with a commanding gesture. “Please sit down,” he
said. “W e have a wait of half an hour , I think.”
“Thirty-one minutes,” Ausable said moodily. “The appointment was
for twelve-thirty. I wish I knew how you learned about the report, Max.”
The little spy smiled evilly. “And we wish we knew how your people
got the report. But no harm has been done. I will get it back tonight.
What is that? Who is at the door?”
Fowler jumped at the sudden knocking at the door . Ausable just
smiled. “That will be the police,” he said. “I thought that such an
important paper as the one we are waiting for should have a little
extra protection. I told them to check on me to make sure everything
was all right.”
Max bit his lip nervously. The knocking was repeated.
“What will you do now, Max?” Ausable asked. “If I do not answer the
door, they will enter anyway. The door is unlocked. And they will not
hesitate to shoot.”
Max’s face was black with anger as he backed swiftly towards the
window. He swung a leg over the sill. “Send them away!” he warned. “I
will wait on the balcony. Send them away or I’ll shoot and take my
chances!”
The knocking at the door became louder and a voice was raised.
“Mr Ausable! Mr Ausable!”

Keeping his body twisted so that his gun still covered the fat man
and his guest, the man at the window grasped the frame with his free
hand to support himself. Then he swung his other leg up and over the
window-sill.
The doorknob turned. Swiftly Max pushed with his left hand to free
himself from the sill and drop to the balcony. And then, as he dropped,
he screamed once, shrilly.
The door opened and a waiter stood there with a tray, a bottle and
two glasses. “Here is the drink you ordered for when you returned,” he
said, and set the tray on the table, deftly uncorked the bottle, and left
the room.
White-faced, Fowler stared after him. “But...” he stammered, “the

“There were no police.” Ausable sighed. “Only Henry, whom I was
expecting.”
“But won’t that man out on the balcony…?” Fowler began.
“No,” said Ausable, “he won’t r eturn. You see, my young friend,

•What does Horace Danby like to collect?
•Why does he steal e very year?
EVERYONE  thought that Horace Danby was a good, honest citizen. He was
about fifty years old and unmarried, and he lived with a housekeeper
who worried over his health. In fact, he was usually very well and happy
except for attacks of hay fever in summer . He made locks and was
successful enough at his business to have two helpers. Y es, Horace
Danby was good and respectable — but not completely honest.
Fifteen years ago, Horace had served his first and only sentence in
a prison library. He loved rare, expensive books. So he robbed a safe
every year . Each year he planned carefully just what he would do,
stole enough to last for twelve months, and secretly bought the books
he loved through an agent.
Now, walking in the bright July sunshine, he felt sure that this
year’s robbery was going to be as successful as all the others. For
two weeks he had been studying the house at Shotover Grange, looking
at its rooms, its electric wiring, its paths and its garden. This afternoon
the two servants, who remained in the Grange while the family was
in London, had gone to the movies. Horace saw them go, and he felt
happy in spite of a little tickle of hay fever in his nose. He came  out
from behind the garden wall, his tools carefully packed in a bag
on his back.
There were about fifteen thousand pounds’ worth of jewels in the
Grange safe. If he sold them one by one, he expected to get at least five
Reprint 2024-25
thousand, enough to make him happy for another year . Ther e wer e
three very interesting books coming up for sale in the autumn. Now he
would get the money he wanted to buy them.
He had seen the housekeeper hang the key to the kitchen door on a
hook outside. He put on a pair of gloves, took the key, and opened the
door. He was always car eful not to leave any fingerprints.
A small dog was lying in the kitchen. It stirred, made a noise, and
moved its tail in a friendly way.
“All right, Sherry,” Horace said as he passed. All you had to do to
keep dogs quiet was to call them by their right names, and show
them love.
The safe was in the drawing room, behind a rather poor painting.
Horace wondered for a moment whether he should collect pictures
instead of books. But they took up too much room. In a small house,
books wer e better .
There was a great bowl of flowers on the table, and Horace felt
his nose tickle. He gave a little sneeze and then put down his bag.
He carefully arranged his tools. He had four hours before the
servants returned.
The safe was not going to be hard to open. After all, he had lived
with locks and safes all his life. The burglar alarm was poorly built.
He went into the hall to cut its wire. He came back and sneezed loudly
as the smell of the flowers came to him again.
How foolish people are when they own valuable things, Horace
thought. A magazine article had described this house, giving a plan of
all the rooms and a picture of this room. The writer had even mentioned
that the painting hid a safe!
But Horace found that the flowers were hindering him in his work.
He buried his face in his handkerchief.
Then he heard a voice say from the doorway, “What is it? A cold or
hay fever?”
Befor e he could think, Horace said, “Hay fever ,” and found himself
sneezing again.
The voice went on, “Y ou can cur e it with a special tr eatment, you
know, if you find out just what plant gives you the disease. I think
you’d better see a doctor , if you’r e serious about your work. I hear d you
from the top of the house just now.”

•Who is speaking to Horace Danby?
•Who is the r eal culprit in the stor y?
It was a quiet, kindly voice, but one with firmness in it. A woman
was standing in the doorway, and Sherry was rubbing against her .
She was young, quite pretty, and was dressed in red. She walked to
the fireplace and straightened the ornaments there.
“Down, Sherry,” she said. “Anyone would think I’d been away for a
month!” She smiled at Horace, and went on, “However , I came back
just in time, though I didn’t expect to meet a bur glar.”
Horace had some hope because she seemed to be amused at meeting
him. He might avoid trouble if he treated her the right way. He replied,
“I didn’t expect to meet one of the family.”
She nodded. “I see what an inconvenience it is for you to meet me.
What are you going to do?”
Horace said, “My first thought was to run.”
“Of course, you could do that. But I would telephone the police and
tell them all about you. They’d get you at once.”

A Question of T rust23Horace said, “I would, of course, cut the telephone wires first and
then...,” he hesitated, a smile on his face, “I would make sure that you
could do nothing for some time. A few hours would be enough.”
She looked at him seriously. “Y ou’d hurt me?”
Horace paused, and then said, “I think I was trying to frighten you
when I said that.”
“You didn’t frighten me.”
Horace suggested, “It would be nice if you would forget you ever
saw me. Let me go.”
The voice was suddenly sharp. “Why should I? Y ou wer e going to
rob me. If I let you go, you’ll only rob someone else. Society must be
protected from men like you.”
Horace smiled. “I’m not a man who threatens society. I steal only
from those who have a lot of money. I steal for a very good reason. And
I hate the thought of prison.”
She laughed, and he begged, thinking that he had persuaded her ,
“Look, I have no right to ask you for anything, but I’m desperate. Let
me go and I promise never to do this kind of thing again. I really
mean it.”
She was silent, watching him closely. Then she said, “Y ou ar e really
afraid of going to prison, aren’t you?”
She came over to him shaking her head. “I have always liked the
wrong kind of people.”
She picked up a silver box from the table and took a cigarette from
it. Horace, eager to please her and seeing that she might help him,
took of f his gloves and gave her his cigar ette lighter .
“You’ll let me go?” He held the lighter towar ds her .
“Yes, but only if you’ll do something for me.”
“Anything you say.”
“Before we left for London, I promised my husband to take my jewels
to our bank; but I left them here in the safe. I want to wear them to a
party tonight, so I came down to get them, but…”
Horace smiled. “Y ou’ve for gotten the numbers to open the safe,
haven’t you?”
“Yes,” r eplied the young lady.
“Just leave it to me and you’ll have them within an hour . But I’ll
have to break your safe.”
“Don’t worry about that. My husband won’t be here for a month,
and I’ll have the safe mended by that time.”

And within an hour
Horace had opened the safe,
given her the jewels, and
gone happily away.
For two days he kept his
promise to the kind young
lady. On the morning of the
third day, however , he
thought of the books he
wanted and he knew he would
have to look for another safe.
But he never got the chance
to begin his plan. By noon a
policeman had arrested him
for the jewel robbery at
Shotover Grange.
His fingerprints, for he
had opened the safe without
gloves, were all over the
room, and no one believed him when he said that the wife of the owner
of the house had asked him to open the safe for her . The wife herself,
a gray-haired, sharp-tongued woman of sixty, said that the story
was nonsense.
Horace is now the assistant librarian in the prison. He often thinks
of the charming, clever young lady who was in the same profession as
he was, and who tricked him. He gets very angry when anyone talks
about ‘honour among thieves’.

•How did the invisible man first become visible?
•Why was he wandering the streets?
THE two boys started in surprise at the fresh muddy imprints of a pair
of bare feet. What was a barefooted man doing on the steps of a house,
in the middle of London? And where was the man?
As they gazed, a remarkable sight met their eyes. A fresh footmark
appeared from nowhere!
Further footprints followed, one after another , descending the steps
and progressing down the street. The boys followed, fascinated, until
the muddy impr essions became fainter and fainter , and at last
disappear ed altogether .
The explanation of the mystery was really simple enough. The
bewildered boys had been following a scientist who had just discovered
how to make the human body transparent.
Griffin, the scientist, had carried out experiment after experiment
to prove that the human body could become invisible. Finally he
swallowed certain rare drugs and his body became as transparent as
a sheet of glass — though it also remained as solid as glass.
Brilliant scientist though he was, Griffin was rather a lawless
person. His landlord disliked him and tried to eject him. In revenge
Griffin set fire to the house. To get away without being seen he had to
remove his clothes. Thus it was that he became a homeless wander er,
without clothes, without money, and quite invisible  — until he

He escaped easily enough from the boys who followed his footprints
in London. But his adventur es wer e by no means over . He had chosen
a bad time of the year to wander about London without clothes. It was
mid-winter . The air was bitterly cold and he could not do without
clothes. Instead of walking about the streets he decided to slip into a
big London store for warmth.
Closing time arrived, and as soon as the doors were shut Griffin
was able to give himself the pleasure of clothing and feeding himself
without regard to expense. He broke open boxes and wrappers and
fitted himself out with warm clothes. Soon, with shoes, an overcoat
and a wide-brimmed hat, he became a fully dressed and visible person.
In the kitchen of the restaurant he found cold meat and coffee, and he
followed up the meal with sweets and wine taken from the grocery
store. Finally he settled down to sleep on a pile of quilts.
If only Griffin had managed to wake up in good time all might have
been well. As it was, he did not wake up until the assistants were
already arriving next morning. When he saw a couple of them

In the end he was able to escape only by quickly taking off his newly-
found clothes. So once more he found himself invisible but naked in
the chill January air .
This time he decided to try the stock of a theatrical company in the
hope of finding not only clothes but also something that would hide
the empty space above his shoulders. Shivering with cold he hurried
to Drury Lane, the centre of the theatre world.
He soon found a suitable shop. He made his way, invisible, upstairs
and came out a little later wearing bandages round his forehead, dark
glasses, false nose, big bushy side-whiskers, and a large hat. To escape
without being seen, he callously attacked the shopkeeper from behind,

“Extraordinary affair!” the clergyman kept saying for the rest of
the day.
But it was not as extraordinary as the behaviour of Mrs Hall’s
furniture a little later that morning.
The landlord and his wife were up very early, and were surprised
to see the scientist’s door wide open. Usually it was shut and locked,
and he was furious if anyone entered his room. The opportunity
seemed too good to be missed.  They peeped r ound the door , saw
nobody, and decided to investigate. The bedclothes were cold, showing
that the scientist must have been up for some time; and stranger
still, the clothes and bandages that he always wore were lying about
the room.
All of a sudden Mrs Hall hear d a snif f close to her ear . A moment
later the hat on the bedpost leapt up and dashed itself into her face.
Then the bedroom chair became alive. Springing into the air it charged
straight at her , legs for emost. As she and her husband tur ned away in
terror, the extraor dinary chair pushed them both out of the r oom and
then appeared to slam and lock the door after them.
Mrs Hall almost fell down the stairs in hysterics. She was convinced
that the room was haunted by spirits, and that the stranger had
somehow caused these to enter into her furniture.
“My poor mother used to sit in that chair ,” she moaned. “T o think it
should rise up against me now!”
The feeling among the neighbours was that the trouble was caused
by witchcraft. But witchcraft or not, when news of the burglary at the
clergyman’s home became known, the strange scientist was strongly
suspected of having had a hand in it. Suspicion grew even stronger
when he suddenly produced some ready cash, though he had admitted
not long before that he had no money.
The village constable was secr etly sent for . Instead of waiting for
the constable, Mrs Hall went to the scientist, who had somehow
mysteriously appeared from his empty bedroom.
“I want to know what you have been doing to my chair upstairs,”
she demanded. “And I want to know how it is you came out of an empty
room and how you entered a locked room.”

•How did a book become a turning point in Richard
Ebright’s life?
•How did his mother help him?
AT the age of twenty-two, a former ‘scout of the year’ excited the scientific
world with a new theory on how cells work. Richard H. Ebright and his
college room-mate explained the theory in an article in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Science.
It was the first time this important scientific journal had ever
published the work of college students. In sports, that would be like
making the big leagues at the age of fifteen and hitting a home run
your first time at bat*. For Richard Ebright, it was the first in a long
string of achievements in science and other fields. And it all started
with butterflies.
An only child, Ebright grew up north of Reading, Pennsylvania.
“There wasn’t much I could do there,” he said. “I certainly couldn’t
play football or baseball with a team of one. But there was one thing I
could do — collect things.”
So he did, and did he ever! Beginning in kindergarten, Ebright
collected butterflies with the same determination that has marked all
his  activities. He also collected rocks, fossils, and coins. He became
an eager astr onomer , too, sometimes star -gazing all night.
*A home run in the game of baseball is when the batter scores a run after running safely
around all bases and back to the home plate without stopping. A ball hit out of the playing
field is also called a home run. Getting a paper published at the age of fifteen in a scientific
journal is here compared to scoring a home run while batting for the first time.Richard□Ebright□has□recieved□the□Searle

From the first he had a driving curiosity along with a bright mind.
He also had a mother who encouraged his interest in learning. She
took him on trips, bought him telescopes, microscopes, cameras,
mounting materials, and other equipment and helped him in many
other ways.
“I was his only companion until he started school,” his mother
said. “After that I would bring home friends for him. But at night we
just did things together . Richie was my whole life after his father died
when Richie was in third grade.”
She and her son spent almost every evening at the dining room
table. “If he didn’t have things to do, I found work for him — not
physical work, but learning things,” his mother said. “He liked it.
He wanted to learn.”
And learn he did. He earned top grades in school. “On everyday
things he was just like every other kid,” his mother said.
By the time he was in the second grade, Ebright had collected all twenty-
five species of butterflies found around his hometown. (See following box.)

“That probably would have been the end of my butterfly collecting,”
he said. “But then my mother got me a children’s book called The
Travels of Monar ch X.” That book, which told how monar ch butter flies
migrate to Central America, opened the world of science to the eager
young collector .

Footprints without F eet 34At the end of the book, readers were invited to help study butterfly
migrations. They were asked to tag butterflies for research by Dr
Frederick  A. Urquhart of the University of Toronto, Canada. Ebright’s
mother wrote to Dr  Urquhart, and soon Ebright was attaching light
adhesive tags to the wings of monarchs. Anyone who found a tagged
butterfly was asked to send the tag to Dr Urquhart.
The butterfly collecting season around Reading lasts six weeks in
late summer . (See graph below.) If you’r e going to chase them one by
one, you won’t catch very many. So the next step for Ebright was to
raise a flock of butterflies. He would catch a female monarch, take her
eggs, and raise them in his basement through their life cycle, from egg
to caterpillar to pupa to adult butterfly. Then he would tag the butterflies’
wings and let them go. For several years his basement was home to
thousands of monarchs in different stages of development.

Collected in Six W eeks
“Eventually I began to lose interest in tagging butterflies. It’s tedious
and there’s not much feedback,” Ebright said. “In all the time I did it,”
he laughed, “only two butterflies I had tagged were recaptured — and
they were not more than seventy-five miles from where I lived.”

The Making of a Scientist 35Then in the seventh grade he got a hint of what real science is
when he entered a county science fair — and lost. “It was really a sad
feeling to sit there and not get anything while everybody else had won
something,” Ebright said. His entry was slides of frog tissues, which
he showed under a microscope. He realised the winners had tried to
do real experiments, not simply make a neat display.
Already the competitive spirit that drives Richard Ebright was
appearing. “I knew that for the next year’s fair I would have to do a real
experiment,” he said. “The subject I knew most about was the insect
work I’d been doing in the past several years.”
So he wrote to Dr Urquhart for ideas, and back came a stack of
suggestions for experiments. Those kept Ebright busy all through
high school and led to prize projects in county and international
science fairs.
For his eighth grade project, Ebright tried to find the cause of a
viral disease that kills nearly all monarch caterpillars every few years.
Ebright thought the disease might be carried by a beetle. He tried
raising caterpillars in the presence of beetles. “I didn’t get any real
results,” he said. “But I went ahead and showed that I had tried the
experiment. This time I won.”
The next year his science fair project was testing the theory that
viceroy butterflies copy monarchs. The theory was that viceroys look
like monarchs because monarchs don’t taste good to birds. Viceroys,
on the other hand, do taste good
to birds. So the more they look like
monarchs, the less likely they are
to become a bir d’s dinner .
Ebright’s project was to see
whether , in fact, bir ds would eat
monarchs. He found that a
starling would not eat ordinary
bird food. It would eat all the
monarchs it could get. (Ebright
said later research by other people
showed that viceroys probably do
copy the monarch.) This project
was placed first in the zoology
division and third overall in the
county science fair .How is the monarch butterfly (top)
different from the viceroy butterfly (bottom)?
Reprint 2024-25
Footprints without F eet 36In his second year in high school, Richard Ebright began the research
that led to his discovery of an unknown insect hormone. lndirectly, it
also led to his new theory on the life of cells.
The question he tried to answer was simple: What is the purpose of
the twelve tiny gold spots on a monarch pupa?
“Everyone assumed the spots were just ornamental,” Ebright said.
“But Dr Urquhart didn’t believe it.”
To find the answer , Ebright and another excellent science student
first had to build a device that showed that the spots were producing a
hormone necessary for the butterfly’s full development.
This project won Ebright first place in the county fair and entry
into the Inter national Science and Engineering Fair . Ther e he won
third place for zoology. He also got a chance to work during the
summer at the entomology laboratory of the W alter Reed Ar my
Institute of Research.
As a high school junior , Richar d Ebright continued his advanced
experiments on the monarch pupa. That year his project won first
place at the International Science Fair and gave him another chance
to work in the ar my laboratory during the summer .
In his senior year , he went a step further . He gr ew cells fr om a
monarch’s wing in a culture and showed that the cells would divide
and develop into normal butterfly wing scales only if they were fed
the hormone from the gold spots. That project won first place for
zoology at the Inter national Fair . He spent the summer after graduation
doing further work at the army laboratory  and at the laboratory of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The following summer , after his fr eshman year at Harvar d
University, Ebright went back to the laboratory of the Department of
Agriculture and did more work on the hormone from the gold spots.
Using the laboratory’s sophisticated instruments, he was able to
identify the hormone’s chemical structure.
A year -and-a-half later , during his junior year , Ebright got the idea
for his new theory about cell life. It came while he was looking at X-ray
photos of the chemical structure of a hormone.
When he saw those photos, Ebright didn’t shout, ‘Eureka!’ or even,
‘I’ve got it!’ But he believed that, along with his findings about insect
hormones, the photos gave him the answer to one of biology’s puzzles:
how the cell can ‘read’ the blueprint of its DNA. DNA is the substance
in the nucleus of a cell that controls heredity. It determines the form
and function of the cell. Thus DNA is the blueprint for life.
Reprint 2024-25
The Making of a Scientist 37Ebright and his college room-mate, James R. W ong, worked all that
night drawing pictures and constructing plastic models of molecules
to show how it could happen. Together they later wrote the paper that
explained the theory.
Surprising no one who knew him, Richard Ebright graduated from
Harvard with highest honours, second in his class of 1,510. Ebright
went on to become a graduate student researcher at Harvard Medical
School. There he began doing experiments to test his theory.
If the theory proves correct, it will be a big step towards
understanding the processes of life. It might also lead to new ideas for
preventing some types of cancer and other diseases. All of this is possible
because of Ebright’s scientific curiosity. His high school research into
the purpose of the spots on a monarch pupa eventually led him to his
theory about cell life.
Richard Ebright has been interested in science since he first began
collecting butterflies — but not so deeply that he hasn’t time for other
interests. Ebright also became a champion debater and public speaker
and a good canoeist and all-around outdoors-person. He is also an
expert photographer , particularly of natur e and scientific exhibits.
In high school Richard Ebright was a straight-A student. Because
learning was easy, he turned a lot of his energy towards the Debating
and Model United Nations clubs. He also found someone to admire —
Richar d A. W eiher er, his social studies teacher and adviser to both
clubs. “Mr W eiher er was the per fect person for me then. He opened my
mind to new ideas,” Ebright said.
“Richar d would always give that extra ef fort,” Mr W eiher er said.
“What pleased me was, here was this person who put in three or four
hours at night doing debate research besides doing all his research
with butterflies and his other interests.
“Richar d was competitive,” Mr W eiher er continued, “but not in a
bad sense.” He explained, “Richard wasn’t interested in winning for
winning’s sake or winning to get a prize. Rather , he was winning
because he wanted to do the best job he could. For the right reasons,
he wants to be the best.”
And that is one of the ingredients in the making of a scientist.
Start with a first-rate mind, add curiosity, and mix in the will to win
for the right reasons. Ebright has these qualities. From the time the
book, The T ravels of Monar ch X,  opened the world of science to him,
Richard Ebright has never lost his scientific curiosity.

And she responded, “I am vexed not to have a jewel, nothing to

He went to the police and to the cab offices, and put an

at forty thousand francs. They could get it for thirty-six thousand.
Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs, which his father had left
him. He borrowed the rest. He made ruinous promises, took money from
usurers and the whole race of lenders. Then he went to get the new
necklace, depositing on the merchant’s counter thirty-six thousand francs.

grocer’s, the butcher’s and the fruiterer’s, with her basket on her arm,
shopping, haggling to the last sou of her miserable money.
The husband worked evenings, putting the books of some merchants
in order, and nights he often did copying at five sous a page. And this
life lasted for ten years. At the end of ten years, they had restored all.
Mme Loisel seemed old now. She had become a strong, hard woman,
the crude woman of the poor household. Her hair badly dressed, her
skirts awry, her hands red, she spoke in a loud tone, and washed the

rid herself of the cares of the week, she suddenly perceived a woman
walking with a child. It was Mme For estier , still young, still pr etty,
still attractive. Mme Loisel was affected. Should she speak to her?
Yes, certainly. And now that she had paid, she would tell her all.
Why not?
She appr oached her . “Good mor ning, Jeanne.”
Her friend did not recognise her and was astonished to be so
familiarly addressed by this common personage. She stammered, “But,
Madame — I do not know — you must be mistaken—”
“No, I am Matilda Loisel.”
Her friend uttered a cry of astonishment, “Oh! my poor Matilda!
How you have changed!”

“Yes, I have had some hard days since I saw you; and some miserable

“Because of me? How is that?”
“You recall the diamond necklace that you loaned me to wear to the
Minister’s ball?”
“Yes, very well.”
“Well, I lost it.”
“How is that, since you returned it to me?”
“I returned another to you exactly like it. And it has taken us ten
years to pay for it. Y ou can understand that it was not easy for us who
have nothing. But it is finished and I am decently content.”
Mme For estier stopped short. She said, “Y ou say that you bought a
diamond necklace to replace mine?”
“Yes. You did not per ceive it then? They wer e just alike.”
And she smiled with proud and simple joy. Mme Forestier was
touched and took both her hands as she replied, “Oh! My poor Matilda!
Mine were false. They were not worth over five hundred francs!”

•Why is Bholi’s father worried about her?
•For what unusual reasons is Bholi sent to school?
HER name was Sulekha, but since her childhood everyone had been
calling her Bholi, the simpleton.
She was the fourth daughter of Numberdar Ramlal. When she was
ten months old, she had fallen off the cot on her head and perhaps it
had damaged some part of her brain. That was why she remained a
backward child and came to be known as Bholi, the simpleton.
At birth, the child was very fair and pretty. But when she was two
years old, she had an attack of small-pox. Only the eyes were saved,
but the entire body was permanently disfigured by deep black pock-
marks. Little Sulekha could not speak till she was five, and when at
last she learnt to speak, she stammered. The other children often
made fun of her and mimicked her . As a r esult, she talked very little.
 Ramlal had seven children — three sons and four daughters, and
the youngest of them was Bholi. It was a prosperous farmer’s household
and there was plenty to eat and drink. All the children except Bholi
were healthy and strong. The sons had been sent to the city to study in
schools and later in colleges. Of the daughters, Radha, the eldest, had
already been married. The second daughter Mangla’s marriage had also
been settled, and when that was done, Ramlal would think of the third,
Champa. They were good-looking, healthy girls, and it was not difficult
to find bridegrooms for them.
But Ramlal was worried about Bholi. She had neither good looks
nor intelligence.

Footprints without F eet 48Bholi was seven years old when Mangla was married. The same
year a primary school for girls was opened in their village. The Tehsildar
sahib  came to perform its opening ceremony. He said to Ramlal, “As a
revenue official you are the representative of the government in the
village and so you must set an example to the villagers. Y ou must send
your daughters to school.”
That night when Ramlal consulted his wife, she cried, “Are you
crazy? If girls go to school, who will marry them?”
But Ramlal had not the courage to disobey the Tehsildar . At last his
wife said, “I will tell you what to do. Send Bholi to school. As it is, there
is little chance of her getting married, with her ugly face and lack of
sense. Let the teachers at school worry about her .”

know what a school was like. She remembered how a few days ago
their old cow, Lakshmi, had been turned out of the house and sold.
“N-n-n-n NO, no-no-no,” she shouted in terror and pulled her hand
away from her father’s grip.
“What’s the matter with you, you fool?” shouted Ramlal. “I am only
taking you to school.” Then he told his wife, “Let her wear some decent
clothes today, or else what will the teachers and the other schoolgirls
think of us when they see her?”
New clothes had never been made for Bholi. The old dresses of her
sisters wer e passed on to her . No one car ed to mend or wash her
clothes. But today she was lucky to receive a clean dress which had
shrunk after many washings and no longer fitted Champa. She was
even bathed and oil was rubbed into her dry and matted hair . Only
then did she begin to believe that she was being taken to a place better
than her home!
When they reached the school, the children were already in their
classrooms. Ramlal handed over his daughter to the headmistress.
Left alone, the poor girl looked about her with fear -laden eyes. Ther e
were several rooms, and in each room girls like her squatted on mats,
reading from books or writing on slates. The headmistress asked Bholi
to sit down in a corner in one of the classrooms.

Footprints without F eet 50Bholi did not know what exactly a school was like and what
happened there, but she was glad to find so many girls almost of
her own age present there. She hoped that one of these girls might
become her friend.
The lady teacher who was in the class was saying something to the
girls but Bholi could understand nothing. She looked at the pictures
on the wall. The colours fascinated her  — the horse was brown just
like the horse on which the Tehsildar  had come to visit their village;
the goat was black like the goat of their neighbour; the parrot was
green like the parrots she had seen in the mango orchard; and the cow
was just like their Lakshmi. And suddenly Bholi noticed that the teacher
was standing by her side, smiling at her .
“What’s your name, little one?”
“Bh-Bho-Bho-.” She could stammer no further than that.
Then she began to cry and tears flowed from her eyes in a helpless
flood. She kept her head down as she sat in her cor ner, not daring to
look up at the girls who, she knew, wer e still laughing at her .
When the school bell rang, all the girls scurried out of the classroom,
but Bholi dar ed not leave her cor ner. Her head still lower ed, she kept
on sobbing.
“Bholi.”
The teacher’s voice was so soft and soothing! In all her life she had
never been called like that. It touched her heart.
“Get up,” said the teacher . It was not a command, but just a friendly
suggestion. Bholi got up.
“Now tell me your name.”
Sweat br oke out over her whole body. W ould her stammering tongue
again disgrace her? For the sake of this kind woman, however , she
decided to make an effort. She had such a soothing voice; she would
not laugh at her .
“Bh-Bh-Bho-Bho-,” she began to stammer .
“Well done, well done,” the teacher encouraged her . “Come on, now —
the full name?”
“Bh-Bh-Bho-Bholi.” At last she was able to say it and felt relieved
as if it was a great achievement.
“Well done.” The teacher patted her af fectionately and said,
“Put the fear out of your heart and you will be able to speak like
everyone else.”
Bholi looked up as if to ask, ‘Really?’

Bholi 51“Yes, yes, it will be very easy. Y ou just come to school everyday.
Will you come?”
Bholi nodded.
“No, say it aloud.”
“Ye-Ye-Y es.” And Bholi herself was astonished that she had been
able to say it.
“Didn’t I tell you? Now take this book.”
The book was full of nice pictures and the pictures were in colour —
dog, cat, goat, horse, parrot, tiger and a cow just like Lakshmi. And
with every picture was a word in big black letters.
“In one month you will be able to read this book. Then I will give you
a bigger book, then a still bigger one. In time you will be more learned
than anyone else in the village. Then no one will ever be able to laugh at
you. People will listen to you with respect and you will be able to speak
without the slightest stammer . Understand? Now go home, and come
back early tomorrow morning.”
Bholi felt as if suddenly all the bells in the village temple were
ringing and the trees in front of the school-house had blossomed
into big red flowers. Her heart was throbbing with a new hope and a
new life.

•Why do Bholi’s parents accept Bishamber’s marriage  proposal?
•Why does the marriage not take place?
Thus the years passed.
The village became a small town. The little primary school became
a high school. There were now a cinema under a tin shed and a cotton
ginning mill. The mail train began to stop at their railway station.
One night, after dinner , Ramlal said to his wife, “Then, shall I
accept Bishamber’s proposal?”
“Yes, certainly,” his wife said. “Bholi will be lucky to get such a
well-to-do bridegroom. A big shop, a house of his own and I hear
several thousand in the bank. Mor eover , he is not asking for any
dowry.”
“That’s right, but he is not so young, you know — almost the same
age as I am — and he also limps. Mor eover , the childr en from his first
wife are quite grown up.”

no gr eat age for a man. W e are lucky that he is fr om another village
and does not know about her pock-marks and her lack of sense. If we
don’t accept this proposal, she may remain unmarried all her life.”
“Yes, but I wonder what Bholi will say.”
“What will that witless one say? She is like a dumb cow.”
“May be you are right,” muttered Ramlal.
In the other corner of the courtyard, Bholi lay awake on her cot,
listening to her parents’ whispered conversation.
Bishamber Nath was a well-to-do gr ocer. He came with a big party
of friends and relations with him for the wedding. A brass-band playing
a popular tune from an Indian film headed the procession, with the
bridegroom riding a decorated horse. Ramlal was overjoyed to see such
pomp and splendour . He had never dr eamt that his fourth daughter
would have such a grand wedding. Bholi’s elder sisters who had come
for the occasion were envious of her luck.
When the auspicious moment came the priest said, “Bring
the bride.”
Bholi, clad in a red silken bridal dress, was led to the bride’s place
near the sacred fire.
“Garland the bride,” one of his friends prompted Bishamber Nath.
The bridegroom lifted the garland of yellow marigolds. A woman
slipped back the silken veil from the bride’s face. Bishamber took a
quick glance. The garland remained poised in his hands. The bride
slowly pulled down the veil over her face.
“Have you seen her?” said Bishamber to the friend next to him.
“She has pock-marks on her face.”
“So what? Y ou ar e not young either .”
“Maybe. But if I am to marry her , her father must give me five
thousand rupees.”
Ramlal went and placed his turban — his honour — at Bishamber’s
feet. “Do not humiliate me so. Take two thousand rupees.”
“No. Five thousand, or we go back. Keep your daughter .”
“Be a little considerate, please. If you go back, I can never show my
face in the village.”
“Then out with five thousand.”
Tears streaming down his face, Ramlal went in, opened the
safe and counted out the notes. He placed the bundle at the
bridegroom’s feet.

On Bishamber’s greedy face appeared a triumphant smile. He had
gambled and won. “Give me the garland,” he announced.
Once again the veil was slipped back from the bride’s face, but this
time her eyes were not downcast. She was looking up, looking straight
at her prospective husband, and in her eyes there was neither anger
nor hate, only cold contempt.
Bishamber raised the garland to place it round the bride’s neck;
but before he could do so, Bholi’s hand struck out like a streak of
lightning and the garland was flung into the fire. She got up and threw
away the veil.
“Pitaji !” said Bholi in a clear loud voice; and her father , mother ,
sisters, brothers, relations and neighbours were startled to hear her
speak without even the slightest stammer .
“Pitaji! Take back your money. I am not going to marry this man.”

shameless! So ugly and so shameless!”
“Bholi, ar e you crazy?” shouted Ramlal. “Y ou want to disgrace your
family? Have some regard for our izzat!”
“For the sake of your izzat,”  said Bholi, “I was willing to marry this
lame old man. But I will not have such a mean, greedy and contemptible
coward as my husband. I won’t, I won’t, I won’t.”
“What a shameless girl! W e all thought she was a har mless dumb cow.”
Bholi tur ned violently on the old woman, “Y es, Aunty, you ar e
right. Y ou all thought I was a dumb–driven cow. That’s why you wanted
to hand me over to this heartless creature. But now the dumb cow,
the stammering fool, is speaking. Do you want to hear more?”
Bishamber Nath, the gr ocer, started to go back with his party. The
confused bandsmen thought this was the end of the ceremony and
struck up a closing song.
Ramlal stood rooted to the ground, his head bowed low with the
weight of grief and shame.
The flames of the sacred fire slowly died down. Everyone was gone.
Ramlal turned to Bholi and said, “But what about you, no one will ever
marry you now. What shall we do with you?”
And Sulekha said in a voice that was calm and steady, “Don’t you
worry, Pitaji! In your old age I will serve you and Mother and I will teach
in the same school where I learnt so much. Isn’t that right, Ma’am?”
The teacher had all along stood in a cor ner, watching the drama.
“Yes, Bholi, of course,” she r eplied. And in her smiling eyes was the
light of a deep satisfaction that an artist feels when contemplating the
completion of her masterpiece.

nursery rhymes saved the world from a Martian
invasion. As you all know, in the twenty-fifth century,
five hundred years after all this happened, we
Earthlings resumed contact with Mars, and we even
became very friendly with the Martians. By that time,
Great and Mighty Think-Tank had been replaced by
a very clever Martian — the wise and wonderful
Noodle! Oh, yes, we taught the Martians the difference
between sandwiches and books. W e taught them how
to read, too, and we established a model library in
their capital city of Marsopolis. But as you might
expect, there is still one book that the Martians can
never bring themselves to r ead. Y ou’ve guessed it —
Mother Goos e! (She bows and exits right. )

(see questions on page 38)
(i)DNA exists as strands of bases that carry genetic information
specific to each living thing. The sequence of bases of DNA in
each of our cells is the same, but differs from that of any other
living thing except possibly an identical twin. This difference makes
the DNA break at different places when certain proteins called
enzymes are added to it, resulting in smaller DNA fragments of
different sizes. These fragments migrate at different rates in an
electric field, resulting in a unique pattern; this pattern is referred
to as a DNA fingerprint.
Our DNA is inherited from our parents. Some parts come from
the father and some from the mother. DNA fingerprinting can help
identify parentage, since a son or a daughter would always exhibit
a pattern identifiable as coming from both parents. DNA
fingerprinting analysis is very useful in forensic science; from a
single hair or a tiny spot of blood, it is possible to prove the innocence
or guilt of a murder suspect. Similarly, it is also possible to identify
human remains after violent accidents have caused disfigurement.
It has been suggested that in the not so distant future, a DNA
fingerprinting profile of the individual will have to accompany
applications for an ID card, a bank account and a driving license.
Human right groups say this type of “genetic profiling” constitutes
an invasion of privacy. As with a lot of new technology, DNA
fingerprinting also has a potential for abuse.
(ii)Honeybees are very sophisticated at position location and
navigation. It is known that they use the sun as a guide. They
also appear to have a good memory. They convey the information
of a new find of food to the hive through an amazingly clever dance
language. The dance indicates the direction and distance of the
food source with respect to the direction of the sun in the sky! If it
is dark inside the hive and a light bulb is switched on, the dance
is modified to include the light bulb as a new reference direction!
Since bees have pictorial memory of some sort, a direction-finding
mechanism and a way of reckoning distance, they are probably
better equipped for getting back home than any of us!
(iii)Rain is the result of condensation of vapour when the air is cooled
below the dew point. All the vapour in a cloud cannot condense at
the same time and turn into a large pool of water. Pockets of air
move up independently and slowly cool till condensation begins
and water droplets form. It is believed that most raindrops start
out as tiny ice crystals — so tiny that they float down, slowly
accreting more moisture on the way; at lower altitudes, the crystals
melt into water droplets. In colder climates, the crystals reach the
ground as snowflakes.
